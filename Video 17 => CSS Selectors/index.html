        I am in a div. I like maroon color. For me, the div element is selected.
    </div>
    <div class="alt">
        I am also in a div. I like indigo better. For me, the `alt` class is selected.
    </div>
    <div id="alt">
        I am in a div too. I like green better. For me, the `alt` id is selected.
    </div>

            One thing for sure is that everyone likes great font and padding.
            All elements can be selected by the * universal selector. <br>
            I get yellow color as I am a direct child of a div.
        </p>
        <footer>
            <p>
                I am not a direct child of a div so I don't get yellow color. 
                But, I am a decendent of a div so I get grey color.
