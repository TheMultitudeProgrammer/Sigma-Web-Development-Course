        I am a box. My total height is 100px which includes 
        the border, padding and content due to the `box-sizing: border-box` css property.
    </div>
    <div class="box" id="box2">I am another box.</div>

        <ol type="I">
            <li>Margin is not included in total height of any element in any case.</li>
            <li>
                If the 'box-sizing: border-box' css property is used, 
                The total height includes the border, padding and content.
            </li>
            <li>Otherwise, the total height only includes the content.</li>
            <li>
                The margin between two elements is equal to the larger margin of the two elements.
                For Example, <br>If two elements have 20px and 30px as their margin. 
                Then, 30px is applied as the margin between them.
            </li>
